My name is Alexandre Medeiros, my usual nickname is alemedeiros. I'm a Software
Engineer at [Nubank](www.nubank.com.br), I'm a BSc Computer Science graduate
from University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil. I also studied in UK, at Queen
Mary University of London, for a year on an exchange program, Science Without
Borders. While in University I've done a 3 months Software engineering
internship at Google Belo Horizonte office.

I like Computing Theory, Graphs, Functional Programming, Parallel Programming
and Mathematics. I also like to read comics and novels, specially the geeky
ones, like Scott Pilgrim, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or any good
Science Fiction novel.

One of my main activities is taking care of two lovely kittens: Thanatos and
Artemis. They also have a cat friend, Skadi which is my flatmate's cat.
Together they make our lifes lovelier and much more worth while.
