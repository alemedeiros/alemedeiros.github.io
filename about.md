My name is Alexandre Medeiros, my usual nickname is alemedeiros. I'm a Computer Science student at University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil. I studied in UK, at Queen Mary University of London, for a year on an exchange program, Science Without Borders. I've done a 3 months Software engineering internship at Google Belo Horizonte office.

I like Computing Theory, Graphs, Functional Programming, Parallel Programming and Mathematics. I also like to read comics and novels, specially the geeky ones, like Scott Pilgrim, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or any good Science Fiction novel.
