title: About me
---

My name is Alexandre Medeiros, my usual nickname is <tt>alemedeiros</tt>.  I'm a
Computer Science student at University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil.
Currently, I'm on an exchange program, studying for a year on the UK, at Queen
Mary University of London.

I like Computing Theory, Graphs, Fuctional Programming, Parallel Programming and
Mathematics.  I also like to read comics and novels, specially the geeky ones,
like Scott Pilgrim, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or any good Science
Fiction novel.

I'm an Arch Linux user and also a great Free Software enthusiast, my favourite
programming languages are C, Python and Haskell, my editor is Vim and I shall
partake a flame war to defend them at any time.
